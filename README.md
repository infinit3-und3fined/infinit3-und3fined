#### 🍋 **Citrus Theorem #1**  
*When life gives you lemons, don't give lemons back—ask for yellow Mangoes. The universe loves a specific request.*

#### 🍊 **The Forbidden Truth**  
*Oranges are just lemons that finally figured out how to be happy.*

#### 🍈 **The Melon Paradox**  
*What if we're all just watermelons who think we're people? The seeds know the truth.*

## ☁️ Cloud Contemplations

### The Cloud Conundrums

<div align="left" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 1rem; box-sizing: border-box;">

- If a cloud never repeats its shape, is it truly the same cloud we saw yesterday?
- Clouds drift without destination, yet always seem to be exactly where they need to be
- We name their shapes, but who's to say the clouds aren't naming us?

## The Nothin. Manifesto

1. **Question Everything**
   - Especially the questions
   - But also the answers
   - Especially these bullet points

2. **Embrace the Dot**
   - It's not just punctuation
   - It's a state of mind
   - A complete thought in itself

3. **3:17 AM Wisdom**
   - The best thoughts come when you should be sleeping
   - The worst decisions too
   - Choose wisely
